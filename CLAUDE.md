# MLB Prop Analyzer — Project Memory

## What we're building
A web app that produces calibrated MLB player-prop projections (hits, total
bases, strikeouts, etc.) for bettors and fans. Projections must load instantly
and consistently. The model improves over the season by learning from graded results.

## Core architecture principle (most important thing)
Decouple computation from serving. NEVER fetch APIs or run the model inside a
user's web request. A scheduled job does all heavy work ahead of time and writes
finished projections to the database; the frontend only reads those rows. This
is what makes the site instant and reliable.

Data flows ONE direction only:
sources -> scheduled job (fetch, clean, train, project) -> database -> frontend -> user

## Problems this design solves (failures of the previous model)
1. Slow per-prop scans -> precompute; the user reads a finished row.
2. Inconsistent/failing API data reaching the UI -> only the scheduled job talks
   to APIs and normalizes to one clean schema before storing. Frontend never
   touches a raw API.
3. 512MB host memory limit during training -> training happens OFF the web host
   (GitHub Actions / Colab / local); model exported as a small file. The web
   layer only reads.

## Folder structure
- engine/  Python. The ONLY place that touches data APIs or the model.
- db/      Database schema (schema.sql). The contract engine and frontend obey.
- web/     Next.js frontend. Reads the DB and displays. ZERO math/business logic.
- .github/workflows/  The scheduled cron job that runs the engine.

## Conventions (IMPORTANT — these keep the project clean)
- All projection/feature math lives in engine/. The frontend computes nothing.
- One writer (the scheduled job), one reader (the frontend). No component does both.
- Writes to `projections` are idempotent UPSERTs keyed on
  (game_id, player_id, prop_type, projection_date) so re-runs never duplicate rows.
- Logging goes to stdout (Actions captures it). NEVER write log rows into the DB.
- Secrets (Supabase key, etc.) live in Actions secrets or a gitignored .env. Never commit secrets.
- Prefer the simplest thing that works. Don't add tools or abstractions before they're needed.

## Tech stack (all free tiers)
- Data: pybaseball (Statcast/FanGraphs/Baseball Reference) + MLB Stats API
  (statsapi.mlb.com, schedules/lineups, no key).
- Scheduled compute + training: GitHub Actions (cron). Model trained off the web host.
- Storage: Supabase free Postgres (~500MB): players, games, projections, results.
- Frontend: Vercel (free), reads Supabase directly.
- Model: baseline = weighted rolling average (Marcel-style); then XGBoost/LightGBM
  on context features; ensemble the two. Calibrate probabilities (isotonic/Platt),
  check with Brier score and reliability diagram.

## Build sequence (the setup process / roadmap)
1. [DONE] Repo: git init, folders, .gitignore, README, first commit.
2. db/schema.sql — players, games, projections tables (the contract).
3. Create a free Supabase project; run schema.sql there to build the tables.
4. engine/fetch.py + engine/db.py — pull schedule/lineups + stats, normalize, upsert players & games.
5. engine/baseline.py + engine/project.py — compute baseline projections, upsert them. (Working pipeline.)
6. .github/workflows/refresh.yml — run engine on a cron (morning + after lineups). Secrets in Actions.
7. web/ — Next.js page on Vercel that reads projections and displays them. (Live v1.)
8. engine/model.py — add XGBoost, export model.pkl, ensemble with baseline.
9. Add projection_snapshots + grading job -> accumulate labeled data -> retrain.
10. Add calibration + de-vig line comparison for betting edges. NOTE: betting
    lines are the hardest, most fragile data source — isolate them with fallback
    to the last good snapshot so their flakiness never touches the projections.

## Current status
Steps 1-5 complete. Working pipeline runs end-to-end:
- engine/fetch.py — pure MLB Stats API layer. fetch_games(), fetch_starters()
  (probable pitchers linked to game_id, lru_cached), fetch_probable_pitchers()
  (players-table rows). No DB code.
- engine/db.py — the ONLY writer. upsert_players/games/projections, idempotent
  on each table's PK. Uses SUPABASE_KEY (service_role) to bypass RLS; falls back
  to SUPABASE_ANON_KEY. service_role key lives in .env (gitignored).
- engine/baseline.py — weighted rolling strikeout projection from last 30 days
  of pybaseball Statcast (last 5 starts weighted 2x). No DB writes.
- engine/main.py — orchestrates fetch -> upsert -> baseline -> upsert. stdout only.
Verified in Supabase: 15 games, 30 players, 29 strikeout projections.
NOTE: engine/project.py from the roadmap was folded into main.py (orchestrator);
refresh.yml currently calls project.py — point it at main.py in step 6.

Known follow-ups:
- statsapi.lookup_player is fuzzy and can resolve the wrong MLBAM id. Harden
  pitcher id resolution before trusting projections downstream.
- Probable-pitcher bio fields (team/bats/throws) come back None from
  lookup_player; enrich when the model needs them.
- First pybaseball run is slow (cold cache, ~30 per-pitcher calls). Fine for a
  scheduled job; revisit if it bottlenecks.

Next: step 6 — wire refresh.yml cron (stubbed) to main.py, put SUPABASE_URL +
SUPABASE_KEY in Actions secrets. Then step 7 — Next.js frontend.

## Keeping this file current
At the end of each session, update the "Current status" section and record any
new decisions or conventions, so the next session stays in sync.
